# Query-Modifier
In this case I created an ETL using Apache airflow with python (sql alchemy and pandas)
Basically is a simple program which modifies certain values from queries to automathize the lecture and query process
for this specifically case I used a data frame with zip codes and I loop through them to change the values in the queries (nothing special with it)
In the next updates I will make the queries to be send by e-mail and maybe I'll add some webscrapping tools to download the information automatically
